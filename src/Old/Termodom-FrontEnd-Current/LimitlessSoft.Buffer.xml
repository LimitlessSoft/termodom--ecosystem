            By default it is not blocked.
            If you Set() MRE, and try Get() from empty buffer with "updateIfNotFound" parameter set to true,
            it will wait for lock and then check again if buffer has been assigned in meantime.
            If it hasn't been assigned even after wait it will start SetBuffer delegate.
            Buffer will not lock this MRE!
